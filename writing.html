                    A Companion to Ayn Rand (Blackwell Companions to Philosophy)
                </a></h3>
                <p>
                    This expansive Companion to Ayn Rand’s work provides vital orientation and context for scholars and educated readers grappling with Rand’s varied and controversial corpus. Rand’s work has been often ignored and sometimes disdained in the academy, yet she continues to fascinate readers with her dramatic novels, wide-ranging essays, and Objectivism, her philosophy of reason, egoism, and laissez-faire capitalism.

                <p>
                    Foundations of a Free Society brings together some of the most knowledgeable Ayn Rand scholars and proponents of her philosophy, as well as notable critics, putting them in conversation with other intellectuals who also see themselves as defenders of capitalism and individual liberty.
